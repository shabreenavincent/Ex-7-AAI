<H1 ALIGN =CENTER>Implementation of Text  Summarization</H1>

## Aim :

To perform automatic text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
 
## Algorithm :

Step 1 :
Import necessary libraries for natural language processing tasks.

Step 2 :
Download NLTK resources, including the punkt tokenizer and stopwords.

Step 3 :
Define Text Preprocessing Function to tokenize, remove stopwords, and perform stemming.

Step 4 : Define the Text Summarization Function using a simple frequency-based approach.
    - Calculate the frequency of each word in the preprocessed text.
    - Calculate a score for each sentence based on the sum of word frequencies.
    - Select the top N sentences with the highest scores to form the summary.
    
Step 5 : Construct the main program to read the paragraph  and perform text summarization
      - Generate and print the original text.
      - Generate and print the text summary using the  Text Summarization function.
      
## Program :
```
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize,sent_tokenize
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
nltk.download( 'punkt' )
nltk.download( 'stopwords' )
def preprocess_text(text):
	# Tokenize the text into words
	words = word_tokenize(text)
	# Remove stopwords and punctuation
	stop_words= set(stopwords.words( 'english'))
	filtered_words= [word for word in words if word. lower() not in stop_words and word.isalnum()]

	# Stemming
	stemmer = PorterStemmer()

	stemmed_words= [stemmer. stem(word) for word in filtered_words]
	return stemmed_words
def generate_summary(text,num_sentences=3):

	sentences= sent_tokenize(text)
	preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(text)
	# Calculate the frequency of each word
	word_frequencies =nltk. FreqDist (preprocessed_text)

	# Calculate the score for each sentence based on word frequency
	sentence_scores ={}
	for sentence in sentences:
		for word, freq in word_frequencies.items():
			if word in sentence.lower():
				if sentence not in sentence_scores:
					sentence_scores[sentence] = freq
				else:
					sentence_scores[sentence]+= freq
	# Select top N sentences with highest scores
	summary_sentences= sorted(sentence_scores, key=sentence_scores.get,reverse=True) [ : num_sentences]

	return ' '. join(summary_sentences)
if __name__=="__main__":
	input_text ="""

## Result :

Thus ,the program to perform the Text summarization is executed sucessfully.
